# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Vision

This is Phillip Crawford's personal static website (ppkcrawford.com) - currently a simple landing page but intended to grow into a comprehensive personal site showcasing projects, writing, and professional work.

## Development Philosophy

- **Static-first**: Keep it simple with vanilla HTML/CSS/JS unless complexity truly demands otherwise
- **Progressive enhancement**: Start with basic functionality, add features thoughtfully
- **Performance-oriented**: Fast loading, minimal dependencies
- **Personal brand**: Reflect Phillip's professional identity and interests

## Anticipated Growth Areas

- **Portfolio section**: Project showcases with descriptions, tech stacks, and links
- **Blog/Writing**: Technical posts, thoughts, or professional insights
- **About page**: Professional background, skills, contact information
- **Resume/CV**: Downloadable or integrated professional summary
- **Contact methods**: Social links, professional networking

## Technical Approach

Currently vanilla web technologies - when adding features, prefer:
- Semantic HTML for accessibility and SEO
- Modern CSS (flexbox, grid, custom properties)
- Vanilla JavaScript for interactions
- Static site generation only if content management becomes complex

## Deployment

GitHub Pages with custom domain (ppkcrawford.com) - any changes to main branch deploy automatically.
